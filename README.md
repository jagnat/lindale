## Lindalë

Audio plugin framework written in Odin. Currently targeting VST3 on Mac and Windows. Work in progress.

My aim is to create a light plugin wrapper to allow for prototyping and exprimenting with audio plugin development, and to have a long-term learning project. The project is built around a hot-reloading architecture, so that the core audio processing and rendering/UI code can be recompiled and reloaded on the fly without restarting the plugin or the DAW.

### Setting up dev environment
- Symlink the `out/Lindale.vst3` folder into your system's VST3 plugin folder (windows: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`, mac: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3`)
- Optionally, symlink the `out/hot` folder into your system-dependent SDL3 application preferences folder (windows: `%APPDATA%\user\Lindale`, mac: `~/Library/Application Support/user/Lindale`). This folder will be generated by loading the VST3 if it doesn't exist.

### TODO (no particular order):
- [x] ~~Fix SDL3 event loop on Mac, don't create our own render loop in a background thread~~ (Update: SDL3 and Sokol both have problems with managing child windows within a DAW host process. A new render backend is needed.)
- [ ] Rewrite render backend to use metal/directx directly
- [ ] Extend hot reloading:
  - [x] Move audio processing procedures into hotloaded code
  - [ ] Add onHotLoad and onHotUnload handlers to plugin
  - [ ] Look into IComponentHandler::restartComponent for dynamic param configuration in VST3
- [ ] Replace janky method of transferring data between processor and controller with a better transfer buffer
- [ ] Implement some more basic DSP transformations
- [ ] Support CLAP in addition to VST3
