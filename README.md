## Lindalë

VST3 plugin written in Odin.

### Setting up dev environment
- Symlink the `out/Lindale.vst3` folder into your system's VST3 plugin folder (windows: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`, mac: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3`)
- Optionally, symlink the `out/hot` folder into your system-dependent SDL3 application preferences folder (windows: `%APPDATA%\jagi\Lindale`, mac: `~/Library/Application Support/jagi/Lindale`). This folder will be generated by loading the VST3 if it doesn't exist.

### TODO:
- [ ] Fix SDL3 event loop on Mac, don't create our own render loop in a background thread
- [ ] Extend hotloading:
  - [ ] Move audio processing procedures into hotloaded code
  - [ ] Add onHotLoad and onHotUnload handlers to plugin
  - [ ] Look into IComponentHandler::restartComponent for dynamic param configuration?
- [ ] Make sure our allocators are set up correctly
- [ ] Replace janky method of transferring data between processor and controller with a better transfer buffer (either our own, or thru the VST spec)
- [ ] Implement some basic DSP transformations
