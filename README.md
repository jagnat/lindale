# Lindale

VST3 plugin written in Odin.

## Setting up dev environment
- Symlink the `out/Lindale.vst3` folder into your system's VST3 plugin folder (windows: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`, mac: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3`)
- Optionally, symlink the `out/hot` folder into your system-dependent SDL3 application preferences folder (windows: `%APPDATA%\jagi\Lindale`, mac: `~/Library/Application Support/jagi/Lindale`). This folder will be generated by loading the VST3 if it doesn't exist.
